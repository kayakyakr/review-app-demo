<h1>Review Apps Postmortem</h1>
<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
<h5>Fragmented environment</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes it's confusing for internal testers to know what features are active</li>
  <li>Ex: If there's a bug fixed in one branch, but still present in another</li>
  <li>Will probably always be difficult to get product owners to understand how to test w/ review apps</li>
</ul>
<h5>Empty database</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Gives you a fresh start, but means you need to recreate all testing objects.</li>
  <li>The proper way to load a DB is via a seed file.</li>
  <li>Either the seed file needs to be large, or you need to recreate everything leading up to test case</li>
  <li><em>Could</em> copy staging database over, but there are no fixed implementations</li>
  <li>You also wind up with too much stale data.</li>
  <li>Copying db would allow testing the migration path, though.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Client buy-in</h5>
<ul>
  <li>It's just another thing to convince clients to use to get most out of it</li>
</ul>
<h5>3rd party things</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Some 3rd parties want fixed URLS, makes it hard to do things like:</li>
  <li>Oauth</li>
  <li>Extensions</li>
  <li>Etc</li>
</ul>
