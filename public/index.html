<h3>Some other thoughts</h3>
<h5>Working Pivotal flow</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Ticket is delivered when PR is created</li>
  <li>PM (or client) uses Pivotal's QA reviews to pass or fail ticket</li>
  <li>When ticket is passed, developer merges to master (deploys to staging) and moves ticket above a line</li>
  <li>Active clients can accept/reject from staging (rejections should be rare because of the reivew)</li>
  <li>Production deploys can happen any time there are no unaccepted tickets above the line</li>
  <li>Note: Detached clients make this flow hard. In GP, we had to mark everything as accepted ourselves after weekly demo/retro.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Would I use it again?</h5>
<h2>YES</h2>
